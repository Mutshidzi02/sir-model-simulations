# SIR Model Simulations for Infectious Diseases
This repository contains MATLAB code used to simulate the spread of infectious diseases using classical compartmental models: **SIR**, **SEIR**, **SIRD**, and **SEIRD**.

## 🔬 Purpose
The code supports a scientific research project titled:

**"Modeling the Spread of Infectious Diseases Using SIR Model Variants: A Comparative Simulation Study of Measles, Influenza, Ebola, and COVID-19."**

It compares how different SIR-based models reflect the transmission dynamics of four major diseases and offers insights into intervention timing and disease burden.
